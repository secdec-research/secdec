# Python packaging has layers upon layers of cruft (setuptools)
# on top of a very simple concept (zip files extracted into the
# site-packages directory). You can read [1,2,3] to get a sense
# of it.

# In short:
#
# 1. A source distribution (sdist) is a specially named .tar.gz
#    archive with a special file PKG-INFO; it can otherwise
#    contain anything.
#
#    Upon installation (by pip) this file will be extracted into
#    a temporary location, where it must be able to produce a
#    "built distribution".
#
# 2. A build distribution (bdist, aka a wheel) is a specially named
#    zip archive with an extension .whl and three special files:
#    * <package name>-<package version>.dist-info/WHEEL
#    * <package name>-<package version>.dist-info/METADATA
#    * <package name>-<package version>.dist-info/RECORD
#
#    Upon installation this whole archive will be extracted into
#    site-packages, and the RECORD file will be used to keep track
#    of which files belong to which package.
#
# Therefore, in this SConstruct file we must list every source
# for the sdist, and every binary needed in the bdist. Then,
# enscons will handle constructing the special files and the
# archives.
